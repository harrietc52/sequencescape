# A Submission collects multiple Orders together, to define a body of work.
# In the case of non-multiplexed requests the submission is largely redundant,
# but for multiplexed requests it usually helps define which assets will get
# pooled together at multiplexing. There are two Order subclasses which are important
# when it comes to submissions:
# LinearSubmission => Most orders fall in this category. If the submission is multiplexed
#                     results in a single pool for the whole submissions.
# FlexibleSubmission => Allows request types to specify their own pooling rules, which are
#                       used to define pools at the submission level.
# While orders are mostly in charge of building their own requests, Submissions trigger this
# behaviour, and handle multiplexing between orders.
# JG: We may be able to consider relaxing the restrictions in check_orders_compatible? to
# allow us to have mixed submissions. This would avoid the need for complicating the submission
# builders further, and would give finer grained control of the way orders were processed.
# Essentially when it game to stuff like G&T you'd have two separate orders, and then the submission
# would determine they were pooled together. This would mean a slight increase in bulk-submission complexity
# (Each sample would be listed twice) but a massive increase in flexibility, while allowing up to
# defer submission changes until flexible pooling.
