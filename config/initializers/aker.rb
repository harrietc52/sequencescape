# frozen_string_literal: true

# This config setting defines the mapping between models and attributes in Sequencescape and
# attributes from the biomaterials service in Aker, as defined by the Job creation.

# To add a new mapping field from Aker:
#
# 1. Add the field name from aker as a value inside the corresponding list for the key with the SS table name
#     in MAP_SS_TABLES_WITH_AKER
# 2. Add the field name from aker as a key linked with a column name for SS in MAP_AKER_WITH_SS_COLUMNS
#
# After this, if we want to update a new property from Aker into SS models we have to add the field name
# from aker inside the list UPDATABLE_ATTRS_FROM_AKER_INTO_SS.
#
# If we want to update a change in SS into the properties of Aker in the biomaterial service we have to add
# the field name from aker inside the list UPDATABLE_ATTRS_FROM_SS_INTO_AKER.
#
# SS updates will occur on update_attributes() calls
# Aker updates will happen on job completion, because the job message for the material is generated from
# the attributes() method of this class.
